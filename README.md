## üß∞ Packages

### async

Concurrent processing utilities for channels and slices.

#### `MapChannel[T, R](items []T, fn func(T) R) <-chan R`

Applies a transformation function to each element in a slice and returns a read-only channel that emits the transformed results. Processes items asynchronously in a separate goroutine and automatically closes the channel when complete.

#### `ProcessChannel[T, R](input <-chan T, concurrency int, fn func(T) R) <-chan R`

Processes items from an input channel concurrently using the specified number of worker goroutines. Returns a channel of results. Note that the order of results is not guaranteed due to concurrent processing.

---

### crypto

Hash computation utilities supporting SHA-256 and XXH3 algorithms.

#### `Sha256Bytes(bytes []byte) (string, error)`

Computes the SHA-256 hash of a byte slice and returns it as a hexadecimal string.

#### `Sha256File(filePath string) (string, error)`

Computes the SHA-256 hash of a file at the given path and returns it as a lowercase hexadecimal string.

#### `Sha256String(str string) (string, error)`

Computes the SHA-256 hash of a string and returns it as a hexadecimal string.

#### `Xxh3File(filePath string) (string, error)`

Computes the XXH3 hash of a file at the given path and returns it as a lowercase hexadecimal string. XXH3 is significantly faster than SHA-256 for large files.

---

### fetch

HTTP client utilities for downloading files and making REST API requests.

#### `New(headers map[string]string, retries int) *Fetch`

Creates a new Fetch instance with specified headers and retry settings. Automatically sets User-Agent and Content-Type headers if not provided.

#### `GetText(url string) (string, error)`

Performs a GET request to the specified URL and returns the response body as a string.

#### `GetResult(url string, headers map[string]string, result interface{}) (*resty.Response, error)`

Performs a GET request and unmarshals the JSON response body into the provided result interface.

#### `PostResult(url string, headers map[string]string, body interface{}, result interface{}) (*resty.Response, error)`

Performs a POST request with a JSON body and unmarshals the response into the provided result interface.

#### `NewRequest(url string, filePath string, headers map[string]string) (*Request, error)`

Creates a new download request with the specified URL, file path, and optional headers.

#### `DownloadFile(request *Request) *Response`

Downloads a single file based on the provided request. Supports resume capability, progress tracking, and automatic retries with exponential backoff. Uses BLAKE3 hashing for integrity verification.

#### `GetFileCookies(filePath string) ([]Cookie, error)`

Reads cookies from a Netscape-format cookie file and returns them as a slice of Cookie structs.

#### `GetBrowserCookies(domain string) []Cookie`

Retrieves cookies for a specific domain from installed browsers on the system.

#### `CookiesToHeader(cookies []Cookie) string`

Converts a slice of cookies into a properly formatted Cookie header string.

---

### fs

File system operations including temporary file/directory creation, user config management, and archive extraction.

#### `CopyFiles(sources []string, destDir string, flags CopyFlags, exts []string) error`

Copies files and/or directories to a destination directory with flexible options. The flags parameter controls copy behavior. The exts parameter filters files by extension. If nil or empty, no extension filtering is applied.

#### `ListPath(directory string, flags Flags, fileExt []string) ([]string, error)`

Traverses a directory and returns a list of paths based on flags (LpDir, LpFile, LpRecursive) and file extensions. Extensions are case-insensitive and should include the dot (e.g., ".txt").

#### `MkTempDir(pattern string) (string, func(), error)`

Creates a temporary directory with the given pattern prefix and returns the directory path along with a cleanup function that should be deferred.

#### `MkTempFile(directory string, pattern string) (*os.File, func(), error)`

Creates a temporary file in a directory with the given pattern and returns the file object along with a cleanup function.

#### `MkUserConfigDir(name string, parts ...string) (string, error)`

Creates a directory within the user's platform-specific configuration directory (e.g., ~/.config on Linux). Supports nested subdirectories through optional path parts.

#### `MkUserConfigFile(name string, parts ...string) (*os.File, error)`

Creates a file in the user's configuration directory with the specified application name and path components. Creates all necessary parent directories if they don't exist.

#### `Unzip(zipPath, targetDirectory string) error`

Extracts all files and directories from a ZIP archive to a target directory. Implements security measures to prevent Zip Slip attacks by validating paths and preventing traversal.

#### `UntarXz(tarXzPath, targetDirectory string) error`

Extracts all files and directories from a TAR.XZ archive to a target directory. Includes security measures against path traversal attacks and preserves file permissions.

---

### github

GitHub API utilities for release management.

#### `GetLatestRelease(owner, repo string) (*github.RepositoryRelease, error)`

Retrieves the latest published release for the specified GitHub repository, including tag name, body, assets, and other metadata.

#### `GetReleaseByName(owner, repo, tagName string) (*github.RepositoryRelease, error)`

Retrieves a specific release by its tag name for the specified GitHub repository.

#### `IsOutdatedRelease(owner, repo, version string) bool`

Checks if a given version is outdated compared to the latest release of a GitHub repository using semantic version comparison. Automatically handles version prefixes and returns false on errors.

---

### memo

Memoization utilities with support for memory-only, disk-only, and hybrid memory-disk caching strategies.

#### `NewMemoryOnly(opts CacheOpts) (*Memoizer, error)`

Creates a new Memoizer instance that uses only in-memory storage. Supports configuration of maximum entries and capacity.

#### `NewDiskOnly(directory string, opts CacheOpts) (*Memoizer, error)`

Creates a new Memoizer that uses disk-based storage (Badger database) in the specified directory. Persists cached values between runs.

#### `NewMemoryDisk(path string, opts CacheOpts, promoteTTL time.Duration) (*Memoizer, func() error, error)`

Creates a new Memoizer with a two-tier memory-disk composite store. Uses in-memory cache as L1 and disk-based cache as L2, with automatic promotion of disk hits to memory.

#### `NewMemoizer(store internal.Store) *Memoizer`

Creates a new Memoizer instance with a custom store implementation.

#### `Do[T any](m *Memoizer, ctx context.Context, key string, ttl time.Duration, compute func(context.Context) (T, error)) (T, error)`

Executes a memoized computation with the given key and TTL. Checks cache first, uses singleflight to deduplicate concurrent calls, executes the compute function on cache miss, and caches the result.

#### `KeyFrom(parts ...any) string`

Generates a SHA-256 hash key from the provided parts using gob encoding. Useful for creating consistent cache keys from multiple values.

#### `Close() error`

Closes the Memoizer and releases any resources held by the underlying store. Should be called when the Memoizer is no longer needed.

---

### time

Time and duration utilities for ETA calculation and custom time formats.

#### `CalculateEta(total, completed int, elapsed time.Duration) time.Duration`

Estimates the time remaining to complete a task based on progress made so far. Calculates average time per completed unit and extrapolates for remaining work.

#### `EpochTime`

A wrapper around time.Time that handles JSON unmarshalling of epoch time (Unix timestamps). Automatically converts numeric JSON values to time.Time objects.

#### `NotzTime`

A wrapper around time.Time that handles JSON unmarshalling of time strings without timezone information. Parses timestamps in the format "2006-01-02T15:04:05".

---

### types

Generic utility types.

#### `Result[T any]`

A generic struct that represents the result of an operation, containing both data of type T and an error. Provides an `IsSuccess()` method that returns true if no error occurred.
